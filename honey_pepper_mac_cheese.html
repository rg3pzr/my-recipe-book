            <ol>
                <li>Cook protein pasta as directed. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Dice chicken into ~1 inch cubes. Season with pepper and toss in 1 tbsp corn starch and 1 beaten egg. Air fry until golden brown on the outside (about 8-10 minutes at 375 F).</li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine sriracha, honey, soy sauce, and minced garlic. Heat in pan until the sauce thickens (add a corn starch slurry to give a nice gloss and thicken sauce). Add in chicken until combined and set to side.</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, add evaporated milk, chicken broth, and cream cheese. Heat until smooth. Add cheddar cheese until melted and creamy. Make sure the heat is not too high or else it will burn!</li>
                <li>Add cooked pasta into the cheese sauce. Mix well until combined.</li>
                <li>Optionally, mix the chicken and pasta with sauce together, but I think it is best to keep them and eat them separate.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
