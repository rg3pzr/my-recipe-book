            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a large baking tray with a piece of parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Add the flour, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl, and whisk to combine. Add the yogurt and sourdough to the bowl, and stir until it forms a shaggy dough. At that point, use your hands to knead a few times until it forms a smooth dough (the dough will be a bit tacky, but it should come together nicely).</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into six equal portions. Oil your hands or dip them in water. Roll each portion of dough into a ball; working with one ball at a time, insert a finger in the center, gently working it out to form the hole in the middle of each bagel.</li>
                <li>Place the bagels spaced evenly apart on the prepared tray. Brush a little egg wash on top of each and add any toppings you like. Bake until the bagels are puffed on top and golden on the bottom, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
